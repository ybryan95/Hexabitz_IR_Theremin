## About Hexabitz ##

Hexabitz is a new kind of electronic prototyping platforms with game-changing modularity and a hint of biomimicry. Hexabitz modules connect with each other using a novel edge-soldering system and allow you to build tidy, compact and completely re-configurable electronic boards. **Learn more about Hexabitz [here](https://www.hexabitz.com/)**.

- To directly upload firmware to the modules, go to [hex backup] â†’ and install "H08R6-Module 1" and "H08R6-Module 2"  to 
the two of the modules.

## How do I get set up? ##

### If you want to load a precompiled HEX file ###

1- Navigate to *Compiled* folder and load the appropriate HEX file using any firmware update method described [here](https://hackaday.io/project/76446-hexabitz-modular-electronics-for-real/log/137477-how-to-update-module-firmware).

### If you want to compile the code: ###

1- If you don't have uVision installed already, download Keil uVision MDK toolchain from [here](http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/). Get your free [license](http://www.keil.com/) for STM32F0 MCUs!

2- Download or clone this repository source code and open the uVion projext in MDK-ARM folder (it has .uvprojx extension).

3- If you are loading a single module, simply compile the code and load it to module MCU via one of the firmware update methods explaind [here](https://hackaday.io/project/76446-hexabitz-modular-electronics-for-real/log/137477-how-to-update-module-firmware).

4- If you are loading multiple modules of the same type (connected in an array) and you want them to have unique firmware, then manually modify the module ID in Options for Target >> C/C++ >> Preprocessor Symbols >> Define >> _module=x (where x is the module ID) and in Output >> Name of Executable. Recompile the project and load each module according to its ID. You can also create multiple targets as explained in the firmware update [guide]().

You can also compile using GCC on your favorite toolchain.

### How do I test? ###

1- If code is loaded correctly, you should see one or few indicator LED blinks when you power-cycle.

2- Use [RealTerm](https://sourceforge.net/projects/realterm/) or any other terminal emulator with a USB-to-USRT cable to access the module CLI. Learn about using the CLI [here](https://hackaday.io/project/76446-hexabitz-modular-electronics-for-real/log/137487-using-the-command-line-interface-cli).

3- Check available CLI commands by typing *help* or use the module factsheet. Make sure the factsheet BOS version number (at the footer) matches the source code version you have.

### How do I update the source code for an old project? ###

1- If your project follows portability guidelines, then just keep all files in the *User* folder and replace all other folders with the newer source code.

### Where should I add my code? ###

To preseve maximum code portability between projects, we advise you to:

1- Keep all your custom source and header files in the *User* folder.

2- Add your code to the *FrontEndTask()* in *main.c* and add other custom functions there including custom interrupt callbacks.

3- Add any external header files you want to include to the *project.h* file.

4- Add any topology header files to *User* folder and include them in *project.h*.
